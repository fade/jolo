# /next

Recommend what to work on next from the open task list.

## Arguments

- `[filter]` — optional keyword to narrow scope (e.g., `jolo`, `emacs`, `security`)

## Instructions

### 1. Gather context

- Read `docs/TODO.org` for all open `TODO` items
- Run `git log --oneline -n 10` to see recent momentum (what area was last worked on)
- If a filter argument is given, only consider matching items

### 2. Assess each open item

For each TODO, estimate:

- **Effort**: small (< 1 hour), medium (1-4 hours), large (4+ hours)
- **Impact**: how much it improves the project
- **Momentum**: is it in the same area as recent work (lower context-switch cost)

Base effort estimates on what you can see in the codebase — check if referenced branches, files, or partial work already exist.

### 3. Present the list

Print a ranked table, ordered from least effort to most effort:

```
Effort   Item                                    Notes
──────   ─────────────────────────────────────   ─────────────────────
small    Fix X                                   Branch exists, 1 file
medium   Add Y support                           Needs research
large    Rework Z                                Touches 5+ files
```

After the table, recommend one item to start with and briefly explain why (effort/impact/momentum tradeoff).

### 4. Offer to start

Ask if the user wants to begin working on the recommended item.

## Rules

- Read-only: do not modify any files
- Be honest about effort — don't underestimate to make items look appealing
- If a TODO references a branch, check if it still exists before claiming partial work
- If TODO.org is missing or empty, say so and suggest creating one
